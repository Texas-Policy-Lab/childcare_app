## Data

### Childcare data

The childcare demand data by CBSA were collected from Yale's Childcare COVID-19 Response [map](https://covid.yale.edu/innovation/mapping/childcare/). The associated paper and [analysis](https://github.com/jbayham/us_childcare_obligations) indicated the data were collected from [CPS-IPUMS](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/). The CPS_IPUMS data contain a variable called metfips which is the geographical statistical area. The [documentation](https://cps.ipums.org/cps/codes/metfips_2014onward_codes.shtml) for the metfips variable uses CBSA data from February 2013.

### CBSA 

CBSA data are from the [Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/demo/metro-micro/delineation-files.html). This project utilizes the CBSA data from February 2013 which can be downloaded [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/geographies/reference-files/2013/delineation-files/list1.xls). Data is used from 2013 because the CPS_IPUMS variable metfips uses geographical coding from Febrary 2013.
